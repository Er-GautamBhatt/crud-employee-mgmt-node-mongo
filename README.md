Build an expense tracker app in Django

## Summary
Built a Django app with user authentication that lets users add, edit, and categorize expenses. Provides secure, personalized expense tracking with reports and intuitive UI.

## Project scenario
The team at Apollonia Dental Practice is trying to set the foundations to digitalize employee management. In time, they'll want to have digital records of their employees and departments, assign patients, assign projects, and more. They wish to start by creating a basic CRUD (create/read/update/delete) web app to store and manage employee and department information, which they can continue to develop over time. Your task is to build a database and web app that reflects their current organization, staff members, and departments. The team will use your database and app to create a new digital employee management system to manage the dental practice and workforce.
